which technology in big data?,"Hadoop, Apache Spark, Map reduce....","I don't know. The context discusses ""Big data technologies"" in general and their purpose, but it does not name a specific technology.",data/Big data - Wikipedia.pdf p.0,5,5,5,5,5,False,5.0,"The model accurately states that the context does not provide specific technology names, which is true. It is completely faithful to the context and clearly explains why it cannot answer the question as posed by the reference. The model correctly avoids hallucinating information not present in the context."
what is the Characteristics in big data?,"Big data can be described by the following characteristics:*   **Volume**: The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes (source, 34).*   **Variety**: The type and nature of the data. This includes structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.*   **Value**: The worth in information that can be achieved by processing and analyzing large datasets. It can also represent the profitability of information retrieved from big data analysis (source, 38).*   **Variability**: The characteristic of changing formats, structure, or sources of big data. Big data can integrate raw data from multiple sources and involve transformations of unstructured data to structured data.Other possible characteristics include **Exhaustive** (source, 39).","Big data can be described by the following characteristics:

*   **Volume**: The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes (source, 34).
*   **Variety**: The type and nature of the data, which can range from structured to semi-structured or unstructured.",data/Big data - Wikipedia.pdf p.0,5,5,5,2,5,False,4.4,"The model accurately and faithfully extracts the characteristics of big data (Volume and Variety) from the provided context. It is clear and relevant to the question. However, it is incomplete compared to the reference answer, which lists additional characteristics not present in the given context."
what is the diffrent betweeen big data and bi,what is the diffrent betweeen big data and bi,"I don't know the specific differences between Big Data and Business Intelligence from the provided context. However, a publication by Dedić and Stanier (2017) titled ""Towards Differentiating Business Intelligence, Big Data, Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery"" aims to differentiate these concepts (Dedić & Stanier, 2017, pp. 114–22).",data/Big data - Wikipedia.pdf p.0,5,5,5,5,5,True,5.0,"The model accurately states that the specific differences are not in the context, which is correct. It faithfully extracts the relevant citation about differentiating these concepts. The answer is clear, complete, and highly relevant given the limitations of the provided context."
Who is Avi Yashar?,I don't know,I don't know.,data/Big data - Wikipedia.pdf p.0,5,5,5,5,5,True,5.0,"The model correctly identified that the information about Avi Yashar is not present in the provided context. Its answer is accurate, faithful, relevant, complete, and clear, perfectly matching the reference answer."
